# TeamGenerator
The Team Generator App is a simple web application built using Angular that allows users to generate random teams based on the names they input. The main goal of the app is to help users distribute members evenly into multiple teams for various activities, games, or projects.
Key Features:
1.	Input Names: Users can enter the names of participants, team members, or any group of individuals they wish to organize into teams. The app provides a text input where users can add names one by one.
2.	Specify Number of Teams: Users can specify the desired number of teams they want to create. They can set the number using an input field provided in the app.
3.	Generate Random Teams: Once the names and the number of teams are entered, users can click the "Generate " button. The app will then randomly divide the names into the specified number of teams.
4.	Error Handling: The app provides error handling to ensure that the input is valid. It checks for conditions such as empty name fields, an invalid number of teams, or insufficient names to form the desired number of teams.
5.	Displaying Teams: After generating the teams, the app displays the resulting teams on the screen. Each team is labeled, and the names of its members are listed below the label.
6.	Responsive Design: The app is designed to be responsive and work well on different screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. It ensures a smooth user experience across all platforms.
7.	User-Friendly Interface: The interface is kept simple and intuitive, making it easy for users to interact with the app. Clear instructions and error messages are provided to guide users through the process.
